# Fit-Track
A web application created using HTML,CSS and Javascript that uses geolocation API, localstorage API and LEAFLET library to render a map of the user's location and let them set their workout activities across the map and calculate their speed or credence. All these details are displayed on a pane on the left side of the page and and clicking on either of the activities navigates the user to that particular activity in the map.
